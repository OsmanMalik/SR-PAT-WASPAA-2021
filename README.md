# Code for WASPAA 2021 paper on SuperResolution PhotoAcoustic Tomography (SR-PAT)

This repo contains the code we used to run the experiments in our paper 

> O. A. Malik, V. V. Narumanchi, S. Becker and T. W. Murray. 
> *Superresolution photoacoustic tomography using random speckle illumination and second order moments*.
> **IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)**,
> pp. 141-145, 2021.

The paper is available [IEEE Xplore](https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA52581.2021.9632758) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03809). 
The code can be used to recreate the plots in Figures 3-5 in that paper.

## Some further details on the code


## Requirements / Running the code

In order to run the k-Wave reconstructions, the k-Wave toolbox for Matlab is required.
It is available for free on the [k-Wave website](http://www.k-wave.org/).
